# Fully functional To Do List

## Project Description
For my final project, I decided to really flesh out the parts I missed during the first project.
During my midterms, I was able to get the front end fully functional. You could:
  - add tasks
  - delete tasks
  - mark complete
  - unmark complete

What you could not do, however, was save and load the tasks. There was something of a save feature,
but it was completely terrible. I had no idea what I was doing. That's why with this final, I decided
to remedy that.

## Features
- add tasks
- delete tasks
- mark complete
- unmark complete
- save
- load

I found it far more enjoyable to make the front end than the back end portion of the code.
The backend was painful because it just didn't feel very responsive in my making.
I disliked having to tab over potentially 3 windows. Alt tabbing 2 windows was my limit.
Any more than that and I hated it. That's why it sucked working on the backend. I was checking
3 windows: vscode, postman, and the documentations for whatever I was working on: mongoose, express.

Another thing I hated was just organizing all the information. I couldn't reset the database very easily.
Once any data was saved, it was painful to undo. I could make an endpoint to delete everything, but that
sucked too. And I know that postman is incredible for creating apis, but having more than 3 tabs in postman
was an excruciating process.

I think I would have liked making the backend server far more if I didn't have to deal with these things.
All in all, React was extremely enjoyable to learn and code. Even if state is an extremely weird thing.
Angular is quite bulkier to start up, but at least it doesn't have useState like React.
